This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Webpack and Babel are both important tools in modern web development, especially in the context of building complex applications like those you might create with Next.js. Here’s a brief overview of what each tool is and what it does:

Webpack
Webpack is a static module bundler for JavaScript applications. When Webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph that maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles. It is highly configurable and can handle not only JavaScript but also assets like images, fonts, and stylesheets. Its core functionalities can be extended with a variety of plugins and loaders, allowing you to optimize and customize the build process to your needs.

Key Features:

Bundling: Combines multiple modules into a few bundled assets to serve to the client, reducing the number of requests needed to load a webpage.
Loaders: Transform the files and assets in your project (like TypeScript, SCSS, and JSX) into JavaScript that browsers can understand.
Plugins: Enhance Webpack’s functionality, allowing you to perform a wide range of tasks like minification, environment variable injection, and much more.
Code Splitting: Allows splitting code into various bundles which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel, improving performance.
Babel
Babel is a JavaScript compiler that lets you convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards-compatible version of JavaScript that can be run by older JavaScript engines. Babel is commonly used to let developers write modern JavaScript syntax without needing to wait for browser support.

Key Features:

Transform syntax: Converts newer JavaScript syntax into older syntax compatible with current environments (e.g., converting ES6+ syntax to ES5).
Polyfill features: Adds functionality that is missing in older browsers (like Promise, Map, Set, and many more ES6+ features), usually through a package like @babel/polyfill.
Source Code Transformations: Allows you to write plugins that can modify JavaScript syntax, enabling advanced features like macros or type systems.
Integration in Next.js
In a Next.js project:

Webpack is configured by default to bundle your application efficiently. Next.js abstracts most of the configuration required, making the development process smoother while still allowing custom configurations through next.config.js.
Babel is also configured to work out of the box with Next.js, compiling your JavaScript code to ensure compatibility with all browsers supported by your application. Custom Babel configuration can be provided via a .babelrc file or babel.config.js.
Together, Webpack and Babel play crucial roles in modern web development, helping developers focus more on writing code and less on the intricacies of browser compatibility and module bundling.
